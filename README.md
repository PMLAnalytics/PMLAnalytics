I'm Paul Manuel Lazarescu 👋

I am a Certified Data Analyst 💻, Services professional💹, Political writer✍️ </br>& CPS Expert (Europe)👨‍💼!
</h2> 

I love the entire process of solving complex business problems leveraging data & the challenge of finding out of box approaches & applying them to increase business. My Github profile is young, and this means I have a lot of runway to showcase various Python, Transact-SQL, Excel, data engineering, data visualizations that demonstrate my technical abilities and ability to apply data science concepts to real-world problems. From data gathering, cleaning and exploration, transformation, to building data pipelines and creating data visualizations, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions.
